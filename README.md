# Trade Hub

This app is intended to help players of Pok√©mon Go coordinate trades by way of establishing a resource where they can easily and clearly display what they need, what they already have, and what they are willing to offer for trade.

Planned features:

* A searchable database of trainers by trainer name

* A list of all currently available variants that a given trainer already has, as well as an automatically calculated list of what they do not.
  -Variants will include shiny, lucky, shadow, gender, legacy moves, and overlap where applicable.

* A wants list for trading, ranked by level of desire.

* A URL generator to create a LeekDuck shiny checklist url.
